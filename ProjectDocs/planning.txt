Data needs to be sorted:
- set of integers
- 2 stacks(lists)
- set of instructions to manipulates stacks

Write 2 programs:
- "checker": takes integers & instructions. Reads and executes instructions and then checks if integers are sorted.
    If sorted output "OK" otherwise output "KO"
- "push_swap": takes integers. Calculates lowest number of actions to sort given integers

Sorting rules:
- 2 stacks "a" & "b"
- "a" contains unique random number of integers(negative & positive)
- goal is to sort "a" in ascending order

Operations:
- sa: swap first 2 elements in "a". Do nothing if "a" empty or only one element | DONE
- sb: same | but for "b" | DONE
- ss: does both "sa" & "sb" | DONE
- pa: take first element in "b" and push it to the top of "a". Do nothing if "b" empty | DONE
- pb: same | but for "a" | DONE
- ra: shift all elements in "a" by 1. First element becomes the last | DONE
- rb: same | but for "b" | DONE
- rr: do both "ra" & "rb" | DONE
- rra: opposite of "ra" | DONE
- rrb: opposite of "rb" | DONE
- rrr: does both "rra" & "rrb"

Start with "checker" then move on to "push_swap"

Tech Stack:
- Python for logic/back-end
- Flask for front-end
- MySQL relational databases to store user info, history of sorts from algorithm(initial stack, output stack, if sorted, version of sorter name),
    statistics like number of steps number of each operation to check efficiency and what not
- API that I will create to generate random list of numbers
